This talk was delivered as part of the TNO 2024 conference. In this work, I used the best dynamical and size distribution estimates for the Centaurs to date, calibrated to the OSSOS survey, with a new survey simulator, Sorcha, to predict the number of Centaur discoveries within LSST. I provided the first robust estimates of Centaur detections over the first few years within LSST, and looked at the implications that the uncertainties in our colour distribution will have on the discovery rate, detectability of phase curves, cometary activity searches, and any opportunities for follow-up lightcurve studies.
